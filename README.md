This project contains code for an browser-based Sudoku solver.  Such
things are not uncommon, but I'm rather proud of this one.  It's
animated, for one thing; its action is tweakable in a couple of nifty
ways; and the underlying code is rather elegant, in my opinion.

It can be seen in action [here](http://seanmcafee.name/sudoku/sudoku.html).
